# Teamwork

I have grouped folks up using my Secret Sauce algorithm that takes into account success in milestone 1, progress in milestone 2, marks from the quizzes, karma, current moon phase, and other various astronomical signs and portents. I've also respected any requests NOT to be paired with someone as well as tried to accommodate requests to work with certain people. Whew.

If you have not completed milestones 1 or 2 to any significant degree, I have placed you together in a group.

Each group will receive an email from me so that you know at least your partner's name and email.

## Staying Out of Merge Conflict Hell

Sharing a repo is like sharing a cramped closet - it's pretty easy to step on the other person's toes and accidentally throw elbows into faces and before you know it you're wondering whether it's a bad thing to wish perhaps (just perhaps...you're not _monster_) your partner would get hit by a car...or perhaps even wish YOU would get hit by a car just to get put of out of your misery.

I can give you a few pointers. They're only going to help a little, but a little is better than none:

### Working Together

Try to work together (either in person or using something like VS Code's [Live Share extension](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/liveshare/)) as much as your schedules allow. This has 2 main benefits:
  - you totally sidestep any possibility of merge conflict hell, and
  - you will likely get more work done - and actually LEARN MORE - than if you work separately. You likely think I'm full of it, because working on 2 things separately MUST be faster than working on 1 thing together. I'm not full of it.

### Working Separately

Sometimes schedules just don't line up between teammates and working together simultaneously isn't on the table. In that case, here are some things you can try:

- Try to work on separate files if at all possible. The minute you decide to work on code that's in the same file, your chances of conflict goes through the roof.
- Try to make your files as self-contained as possible. For example, if you're rolling your own CSS and you have some monstrous global CSS file that affects EVERY MARKUP FILE, then you just KNOW that changing something in that global monster is gonna cause someone else's work to go absolutely wonkers. And this goes TRIPLY so for JavaScript.
- Always PULL from the remote repo before starting any work for the day on your site. You never know what changes have happened between sessions - your partner may have changed something, or maybe YOU did and forgot about it.
- Never PUSH broken stuff back to your main branch on GitHub - you're just polluting that branch now for you and everyone else on the team. Make sure that things are working on your local machine properly before pushing to main. If it's not, then for the love of God, DON'T PUSH.

## Communication

I know you folks are upper-year types and have likely been around the teamwork bush a bit. Nevertheless, I have a few things to toss at you to maybe help you at least be aware of some issues that you could address openly at the start of your journey with your teammates. DO NOT MAKE ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT YOUR TEAM MEMBERS - THAT WAY LIES HEARTACHE, SUFFERING, and DISSOLUTION:

- Do the members of your team do most of their coursework during the morning? afternoon? evening? late-late?
- Do your team members have jobs? what are their hours like?
- How many courses are they taking? what are _those_ hours like?
- Do your team members want to divvy up work, or code together? or a bit of both?
- Do your team members' schedules mesh up with yours? if not, how will you work around this?
- Are your team members alpha coding wolf types? or do they prefer to be given tasks? And what about **you**?
- What are your strengths? Your team members'? You all should try to gain experience in both design and development...but focusing on the things you're good at is a prudent idea, too. Balance, balance.
- **What mark are you shooting for?** Does it match the other members' goals? You both should be honest about this - really honest. Getting an A is gonna take some hours, folks!
- If you plan on doing at least some "code together" work, have you figured out how to do this effectively? will you meet live? or use a tech (I can recommend [VS Code's Live Share extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare)
- Read [this brief pdf](hitchikers.pdf) (it's actually a very short and easy read!) on "hitchhikers" and "couch potatoes".

## GitHub Projects Feature

There is a "Projects" feature in GitHub repos that is pretty cool and which you might find useful for splitting up and tracking tasks between members.

After I notice that a group has accepted the starting repo, I'll make a starting project for them and populate it with the requirements from the milestone.

Here is a [brief talkthrough](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/EC3pxpYxGMDjQKbBiiCg) [5:19] of how to use this feature.

## Don't Be A Thief!

Sorry for the clickbait heading. But.

One of your primary goals in this course is the development of font-end developer skills. Large projects like this provide ample opportunities to develop those skills. 

At this point, you should have a good idea what your current front-end strengths and weaknesses are - so focus on strengthening your *weaknesses*! If you feel comfortable with visual design but are kinda sketchy (at the moment) in JS, DON'T DO ALL THE CSS in your milestones! Instead, make sure you do a lot of JS coding, even if it's outside of your comfort zone - **especially** if it's outside your comfort zone! Otherwise, you're not learning - you're being a thief, stealing opportunities from yourself.

On the flip side of that coin, avoid the temptation of taking opportunities away from your teammates because they're (currently) weaker at something than you are. Give them chances to develop _their_ skills as well. If you're comfortable coding and say "I'll do all the JS", then you're being a thief, stealing opportunities for improvement from your teammates.

"But the marks!", I hear you cry.

I think if you think about the situation carefully and talk things over with your teammates, you'll find compromises are definitely possible. You can all build your skills AND get a good mark, if you work toward that goal together. If you're just in it for the marks, your quest for short-term gain is short-sighted.

## What If My Team Explodes?

I hope this doesn't happen, but life, eh?

I expect folks to communicate with each other in order to prevent explosions. Lack of communication is one of the fundamental causes of things going south.

If something happens that makes team members want to split the party, the first step is to come to me as soon as possible. Communication with me the day before a milestone is due is useless.

When approached by someone with a request to dissolve a group, we'll have a talk. If I feel the request is warranted, then I will move folks into different teams - or perhaps even have some people work alone. This is not a perfect solution, naturally...but you _do_ realize there _is_ no perfect solution, right?

If that process causes some kind of ghastly ripple effect, well then I'll just have to use my human brain, a dose of firm kindness, and some chatting to come to a solution - just like rational human beans do.
