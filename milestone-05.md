# Assignment 01 - Milestone 05 (WIP)

**Due February 16 (W) @ 9 PM**

**Worth 2% of your final grade**

**Content in this milestone document takes precedence over anything you read in the [revised assignment pdf](comp-3512-asg-1-winter-2020-v2.pdf) and previous milestones.**

## Overview

The fifth milestone? Head down, banging out more events. Full stop. 

## Things To Keep On Your Radar

Just a reminder to keep an eye on the things that milestone 4 mentioned to keep an eye on.

You don't want those things to creep up on you.

## Your Mark

Same idea as milestone 4.  

When the ladder below mentions events, it's talking about events you haven't completed from milestone 4 - it's talking about additional events you have completed since your milestone 4 submission.

### The Ladder of Marks
| What You've Done          | Grade Level | Corresponding % |
| ------------------------- | :---------: | :-------------: |
| RS0 incomplete            |   Level 0   |       0%        |
| ---                       |     ---     |       ---       |
| RS0 + fewer than 5 events |   Level 3   |       65%       |
| RS0 + 5 events            |   Level 4   |       75%       |
| RS0 + 10 events           |   Level 5   |       88%       |
| RS0 + 15 events           |   Level 6   |       98%       |

## Submission Requirements

Same as that for milestone 4, but with one twist: I'd like you to add a Label called "milestone 5" to the issues you complete in this milestone. I think you'll find it's very straightforward to do this, so I'll leave you to figure it out.

The reason for this new ask? I need a way to easily tell which of your Done issues is from this milestone when I go mark your project.

### Extensions

For this milestone, I again will not be accepting any extension requests - when I get around to assessing your team's work, I will assess what's available to me at that time. _I will start marking early in the morning of Thursday, February 17. I'll again pick teams at random ( literally - I'll use an online random-number generator) and mark until all teams are marked._
