# COMP2512 - Assignment 1: Movie Browser SPA

## Overview

For this assignment, you'll be developing a single-page application (SPA) that allows users to browse movies from an external API containing data taken from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) ("The Movie Database").

You can look at the [assignment pdf](comp-3512-asg-1-winter-2020-current.pdf) to get an overview of what you're being asked to do, but that is just an **overview**. What you need to do to get *marks* is complete the requirements in each of the milestones described below.

## Staying In The Loop

Large projects, whether in "the real world" or in a course, are liable to change over time. You should Watch (in the GitHub sense) this repository - just as I'm assuming you're doing for the shared-course-material repository - to stay in the loop about important changes to instructions, clarification of fuzzy points, and the like.
