# COMP2512 - Assignment 1: Movie Browser SPA

## Overview

For this assignment, you'll be developing a single-page application (SPA) that allows users to browse movies from an external API containing data taken from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) ("The Movie Database").

You can look at the [assignment pdf](comp-3512-asg-1-winter-2020-current.pdf) to get an overview of what you're being asked to do, but that is just an **overview**. What you need to do to get *marks* is complete the requirements in each of the milestones described below.

## Submissions

Here's how I will **mark** your stuff - once you know that, you'll understand there isn't really a submission process like you have for other courses:

1. When I begin my marking journey, I'll clone the last commit to the `main` branch made before the due date/time. This means you can continue pushing commits to your `main` after the deadline - I just won't be marking those.
2. I'll open up the `marking-walkthrough.md` document and use that to mark the submission.
3. As I mark the submission, I will use the Feedback pull request to provide feedback on the code I see. You should get automated emails for each one of these.
4. When done marking, I'll put a comment summarizing the results and your mark into the Feedback pull request as well. You should get an automated email for this as well.

**In short, as long as you have the things you want me to mark pushed to your `main` on or before the deadline, you've "submitted" your work.**

Most milestones should be marked by 8PM of the Friday following the submission, if not sooner.

## Extensions

If you realize that you are unable to meet some requirements by the submission deadline, you may request an extension of 48 hours - so that's until 9PM of the Friday following the submission deadline.

**If you want an extension, you must request it via email - not Discord - before the submission deadline.** Something along the lines of "I'd like an extension" is perfectly fine.

For milestone 1, since I don't have a full picture of the karma situation - yet - you can ignore the usual rules regarding karma and extensions; this will not be the case for milestones 2 onward.


## Milestones

_All milestones are due at 9:00 PM._

## Staying In The Loop

Large projects, whether in "the real world" or in a course, are liable to change over time. You should Watch (in the GitHub sense) this repository - just as I'm assuming you're doing for the shared-course-material repository - to stay in the loop about important changes to instructions, clarification of fuzzy points, and the like.
