# FAQ

### Q. My files aren't formatting when I save and I know I have Prettier installed.
#### A. Did you run `npm install` in the terminal after you cloned your repo? If not, the tools (in particular eslint and prettier) won't work correctly. You'll need to get into the habit of doing that for all tutorials and all assignments.
