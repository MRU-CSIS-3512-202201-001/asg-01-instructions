# Marking Walkthrough - Milestone 1

_I'm not 100% sure what to call this document. "Marking walkthrough" is good enough for now!_

These are the steps that I will take when I assess your submission. You can use this to figure out which requirements you've completed.

1. Check that I have an email from the student stating group prefs. [1]

2. Head over to the student's GitHub repo created by GH Classroom [2] and confirm it has:
   1. a single html file called `index.html` [8], and
   2. a README.md with their name and a working hyperlink [3], and
   3. the Feedback pull request intact, and [4]
   4. a reasonably-named screenshot file showing their credits [5]

3. Stay in the repo and do some digging into the code:
   1. does `index.html` link to an external JS file called `countdown.js`? [18]
   2. does `countdown.js` use at least one function that is declared via a function declaration? [19]
   3. does `countdown.js` have comments indicating what resources were referenced? [20]

4. Click on the hyperlink in the README. It should go to a netlify url [6] and that url should have a site name in the proper format [7].

5. Copy the url for the app and check it through both the CSS validation service [9] and markup service [10].

6. Pop open the console. Is the correct time remaining shown? [17]

7. Looking at the home page,
   1. do I see a theme-appropriate [13] hero image of desired size [12] (use the inspector to confirm size >= 1800px wide)
   2. do I see credit information for the image? [14]
   3. do I see an obvious way to search for a movie by its title? [15]
   4. do I see an obvious way to view all the movies? [16]
   
8. Check how the page looks at Mobile L and Laptop L sizes. Is there anything jarring that jumps out about the layout at either size? [22]

9. How does the site look at Laptop L size? How are colours, whitespace, alignment? [21]
